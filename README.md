## What is it?

[Uverit SkillPeak](https://newhorizonweb.github.io/Uverit-SkillPeak/) is a user-friendly program that provides a swift and hassle-free experience for creating resumes.
The simple interface enables individuals to effortlessly generate well-structured resumes that effectively showcase their skills and qualifications, without requiring extensive time or resources.

## Program

The user is greeted by a simple "Landing Page" with a button to go to the resume creator.

The program layout depends on the device. On desktop, there's a navigation with the sections, PDF expanded view button, PDF download button and "Settings & Info" section.
On the left, there are the sections with the inputs that are used to fill out the resume.
On the right, there is the resume preview. The changes are applied dynamically, so the user can see the text and design changes live.

In the mobile version, the resume view is hidden and can be accessed via the PDF expanded view button located on the nav dock.

## Sections

There are 7 sections:
- Profile
- Experience
- Education
- Courses
- Skills
- References
- Design

Each section contains inputs for the info that will appear on the resume. All changes are updated automatically.
The section title can be changed directly in the resume preview, just as it were normal, editable text.

### Profile

The first section. It contains the essential info, such as the name, address, professional summary, links, and more.
The user can also upload a photo or QR code that will be displayed on the resume.

### Experience

The user can input up to 8 positions. The section contains the job title, company name, location, start & end date, and the description.
The description has a few additional options, like bold, italic or underline text, inserting bullet or number points (list).

### Education

Similar to the experience section, but the inputs slightly differ. There are: degree, school name, city, start date, end date and the description.

### Courses

This is the section for the finished courses, certifications, etc. The inputs consist of the course, autor, start and end dates.

### Skills

The skills section contains a few subsections:
- Accomplishments
- Skills
- Languages
- Hobbies

Each subsection is self-explanatory. Each contains one input for the corresponding action.
The only exception is the "Languages" subsection. It has an input for the language name and it also contains a select list for the proficiency level (A2, B1, C2, etc.).

### References

This section look similar to the Expierience and Edication sections.
The inputs are: referent's name, company, relationship, e-mail, phone number, and description.

There is also an additional info custom section. 
The user can customize the title. It functions like a description text area - the user can input content like privacy data consent, etc.

### Design

This section contains many inputs to change the resume design. It's a more flexible, customizable way to decide on the design than pre-made templates.

The most important adjustments:
- Page size (A4, US Letter, etc.)
- Aside placement

- Typeface
- Text size (including line height input, and more)
- Gaps, corner rounding, spacing, etc.
- Photo and QR code settings (size, etc.)

& More

## Settings & Info

It's a small section with a dark mode toggle and program version info.
